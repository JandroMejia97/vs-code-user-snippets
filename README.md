# VSCode User Snippets
In this repository you will find the snippets that I use in VSCode to be more efficient when programming in frameworks like Django.

To add this in your snippets you just need to do:
1. Go to File.
2. Preferences.
3. User snippets.
4. Select the language, for example Python. This will generate a JSON file called python.json.
5. Now you just need to copy the code from any of these files into your snippet file.
